# Computer Vision final project

The goal here was to create a independent solution using one of the technique of computer vision learning in the curricular unit, the areas that we could explored was:
+ Negative
+ Colour negative
+ Pseudocolour
+ Colour slicing
+ Chroma key
+ Edge detectors
+ Colour edge detectors
+ Motion quantification
+ Mosaicing
+ Facil detection and recognition
+ **Deep Learning Classifiers**
+ Segmentation

So I choose **Deep Learning Classifiers** and I used this technique applied to one business problem that I have, that was to recognize in a video record or in a real time stream if there was a railway board or not in the scene.
